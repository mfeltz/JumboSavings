        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions<h1>
    </div>
        <p><div id="q">Will this application help me decide what meal plan to get next semester?</div>
        It will not explicitly tell you what plan to get, but by looking at your total efficiency you can choose to adjust your meal plan and printing plan accordingly.</p>
        <p><div id="q">How do you calculate my optimal meal plan and printing plan?</div>
        We insert your JumboCash data and data from Tufts printing services and dining services into a series of algorithms to calculate how you can optimize your JumboCash.</p>
        <p><div id="q">Will you share my data with anyone?</div>
        No. We simply use your data to analyze how you use your meal plan and JumboCash. We promise not to share the data you provide us with any third parties.<p>
        <p><div id="q">Why do I need to enter my email?</div>
        We will use your email as verification if you forget your password. We will never email you spam or give your email out to any third parties</p>
        <p><div id="q">What assumptions did you make calculating these algorithms?</div>
        We will use your email as verification if you forget your password. We will never email you spam or give your email out to any third parties</p>
        <p><div id="q">Who are you?</div>
